## How to use

The entire functionality of the-bson can be imported in one go:

```scala
import io.github.raptros.bson._
import Bson._
```

if you find this too cumbersome, functionality and implicits can also be imported in various objects, e.g.

* implicits for encoding basic types as object fields

    ```scala
    import EncodeBsonField._ 
    ```

* additional implicits and several methods for constructing EncodeBson instances using extraction functions and named fields

    ```scala
    import EncodeBson._ 
    ```

* implicits for decoding basic types from DBObjects

    ```scala
    import DecodeBsonField._ 
    ```
    
* additional implicit decoders (that work at the DBObject level), 
    along with several methods for building DecodeBson instances by extracting named fields and applying constructor functions (or making tuples)

    ```scala
    import DecodeBson._
    ```
    
* implicit classes that give syntax for encoding entire objects or building DBObjects from key-value pairs
    
    ```scala
    import Builders._
    ```
    
* to import implicit classes that wrap DBObjects to allow you to decode entire objects or decode particular fields

    ```scala
    import Extractors._
    ```
