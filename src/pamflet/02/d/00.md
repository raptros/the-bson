### Decoding DBObjects

all decode operations in the-bson produce [DecodeResult][], defined as

```scala
// \/ and NonEmptyList come from scalaz
type DecodeResult[+A] = \/[NonEmptyList[DecodeError], A]
```

if any decode operation fails, all the errors involved will be reported.

----
[DecodeError][] has fixed set of subtypes:

* [NoSuchField][]: a field that was expected to be present in an object is not
* [WrongType][WrongType] and
* [WrongFieldType][]: both result from casting failures, which means the latter is more likely
* [WrongFieldCount][]: see [validateFields in DecodeBson][validateFields]
* [CustomError][]: if you need to report an error that doesn't fit into one of the above ones, you can use this.
